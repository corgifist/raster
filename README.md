<h1 align="center">Raster [WIP]</h1>
<p align="center">Raster is a GPU-Based Node Video Editor with unlimited functionallity!</p>
<p align="center">Currently Raster is not suitable for everyday use, but it improves every day.</p>

What's implemented for now:
* GPU accelerated rendering (using OpenGL ES 3.2)
* Fully controllable rendering pipeline (via nodes)
* Solid audio stack (via audio buses and audio nodes)
* Keyframe interpolation and easing
* Extensible architecture (heavily using shared libraries)
* Separated UI thread and rendering thread 

At the moment, Raster is highly unoptimized. Current goal is just to get things to work, only then optimize them

// One way to avoid texture tile repetition one using one small texture to cover a huge area.
// Based on Voronoise (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xd23Dh), a random offset is applied to
// the texture UVs per Voronoi cell. Distance to the cell is used to smooth the transitions
// between cells.
// It doesn't work with automatic mipmapping - one should compute derivatives by hand.
